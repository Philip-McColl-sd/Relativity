Linear algebra isÂ a branch of mathematics that studies vectors, vector spaces, and linear transformations between them, often expressed through matrices
# 1.  Vector Space  

A collection of elements
$$V = \left\{ A,B,...  \right\}$$
forms a $\textbf{vector space}$ over the real numbers if and only if they obey the following axioms (with a, b real numbers).
1.  V is an abelian ($V$ is Abelian if $a\cdot b =b \cdot a   \nabla a,b \in V$ ) with operation $+ / (A+B=B+A \in V)$ and $0/(A+0=A)$
2.  Multiplication of vectors by real numbers is an operation which gives vectors and which is:
	1. Distributive over vector adition,  $\alpha (A+B)=\alpha(A) + \alpha(B)$ 
	2.
